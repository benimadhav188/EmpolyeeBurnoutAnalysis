EMPLOYMENT BURNOUT ANALYSIS BY AI

Project overview
The Employment Burnout Analysis project aims to explore the prevalence, causes, and effects of burnout in the workplace. 
By using data analytics, surveys, and qualitative assessments, the project will give insights into how burnout effects employee performance, 
well-being, and organizational culture.

Getting Started
To replicate the analysis: Clone the repository:
Bash Copy code git clone https://github.com/benimadhav188/EmpolyeeBurnoutAnalysis
Install the required packages: requirement.txt
Ensure you have the necessary Python packages installed. You can use pip to install them:
Bash Copy code pip install -r requirements.txt Note: The requirements.txt file should list all dependencies. If it's not present, you may need to manually install packages such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib.
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
Navigate to the project directory and open the notebook:
Bash Copy code jupyter notebook ProjectEBA.ipynb Run the analysis:
Execute the cells in the notebook to perform the data analysis and model training.

Project Structure
The analysis in the notebook follows these steps:
Data Loading: Importing the dataset and necessary libraries. Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing data distributions and relationships between variables.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Building: Training machine learning models to predict employee burnout.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using appropriate metrics.
